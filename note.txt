Hey guys, cheers for offering to make some patches for us, it's a really big help. Any sort of sultry ear gravy punter bait y'all could spare is greatly appreaciated =] (we'll have a copy of ableton suite running)

Wish I could get you a Zoa (aka PsychoNip) now, ... but time is short, unfortunately, (we go on Thursday). Will definitely hit you guys up with one after. 

Instead, here is the max for live patch (zoa.amxd) we're making for it, to show how it works as a midi effect. This lets you map to ableton controls and set the sensitivity and origin (nipple's natural resting value) of each of zoas 3 axes (yaw, pitch and roll).

To replace the hardware, you can drag a ZoaMockHardware.amxd in. This let's you set two axes at once with a x-y clicky thing (middle is the origin). 

Thanks again for your help with this dudes - excited to toy with some funky cyber patchwork!

Best,
Aaron
